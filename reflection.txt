## Verification questions

Please use the `RpnCalc` program to answer these questions:

1. How many operations are required to evaluate this expression for the surface area of a
   dodecahedron?  (Note: `edgeLength` is a parameter of the formula and should be parsed as a
   variable.)
   `3 25 10 5 sqrt() * + sqrt() * edgeLength 2 ^ *`

   Answer: 7

2. How many operations are required to evaluate the optimized form of that expression?

   Answer: 2

## Reflection questions

1. What part of the assignment did you find the trickiest to understand or get working?
   Was there a particular insight or diagnostic technique that lead to a breakthrough?

   Answer: evaluateCsv was the hardest to implement as there was quite a bit of new information
   that wasn't completely related to the parts before. For a cell to be used in a later formula,
   its contents must represent a floating-point number (as understood by
   Java's `Double.parseDouble()`), or else it must be a formula itself. I was a bit confused about
   this sentence in the spec of the function, but I managed to figure the logic out later on. I
   just thought about it as two paths. The decider is the "=". It transformed into a big old
   if-else statement. Honestly should have not taken that long to figure out, but it did.
